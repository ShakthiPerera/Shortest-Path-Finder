# Shortest-Path-Finder

Visual Representation of some of the Path finding algorithms.This was built with help of the techwithtim A star Path Finding Visualization Tutorial.This program will give a Matrix contains nodes and at the begining you have to give the starting node and ending node after that you can draw some walls on the matrix after you finsih of the drawing walls.you have to click the key-board button for given algorithm.for now this have Depth First Search, Floodfill, A star algorithms for visualization.

## Initialization of required parameters
Your first left mouse click will indicate the your start node and the second will indicate end node   after the third time your right mouse clikcing will indicate walls,if you want to delete a node or a wall you can do that by clicking the left mouse button on the node or wall that you want to remove.

## Visualizing the algorithm
